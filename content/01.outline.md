- Claims
    1. The PyData ecosystem supports development of scalable scientific software well.
    2. The Xarray API is well suited to statistical genetic data analysis.
    3. GPU support in Python array libraries is unparalleled and can lead to substantial gains in cost efficiency. 
    4. Sgkit can be used to effectively analyze modern genetic datasets, e.g. Ag1000g and UKB.
    5. Xarray, Dask and Zarr constitute a cloud-native, distributed, array-centric data processing framework that has inherent advantages over MapReduce and MPI for genetics
